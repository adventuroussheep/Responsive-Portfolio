                <p class="content1">My name is Jacob. I come from rural Wisconsin and have a B.S. in Geology. Growing up in small town Wisconsin I always wanted to be somewhere else. As a child I spent much of my time online or exploring the woods trying to escape my 8 square block town. By the time I was a Freshman in High School I created my school's website and at the end of the year was presented with a "WebMaster" award. I went on to create small websites for family members and continued learning about website design and networking when I moved to Colorado the following year. This move allowed me to follow my passion of exploration which eventually led me to getting a Geology degree at the University of Wisconsin.</p>
                <div class="content2">
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy hiking, camping, video games, and of course, leaning about new technology. I have been very fortunate in my travels having explored the rugged states of Wyoming, Montana, and most recently Alaska to name a few. The images in the Portfolio page are all taken by me. I hope to combine my passions and hopefully create educational websites and guides on the outdoors.</p>
